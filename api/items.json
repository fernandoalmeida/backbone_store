Instead of clicking through hyperlinks and waiting for each page to load, the user loads a site once and all the interactivity is handled fluidly by a rich JavaScript front end. If you come from a background in ASP.NET development, youâ€™ll be used to handling most interactions on the server side. Pro Single Page Application Development will guide you through your transition to this powerful new application type."

This book will give you a solid foundation for managing async tasks without losing your sanity in a tangle of callbacks. It's a fast-paced guide to the most essential techniques for dealing with async behavior, including PubSub, evented models, and Promises. With these tricks up your sleeve, you'll be better prepared to manage the complexity of large web apps and deliver responsive code.  The concepts in the book are illustrated with runnable examples drawn from both the browser and the Node.js server framework, incorporating complementary libraries including jQuery, Backbone.js, and Async.js. You'll learn how to create dynamic web pages and highly concurrent servers by mastering the art of distributing events to where they need to be handled, rather than nesting callbacks within callbacks within callbacks."

This book presents a pragmatic approach on how you can develop a full application using this pattern. Real code is possibly the best way to explain the advantages of using a design pattern and this book shows a comparison of the code needed to build a sample application adopting and not adopting MVC. Backbone.js, one of the most popular MVC/MV* frameworks, it is also brought as term of comparison. The sample application mentioned previously is built using Backbone.js to show how the use of a framework can help and speed up your development process."
